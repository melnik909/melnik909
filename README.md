### 😊 Readers say
"I have been following Stas for several years, and always pay attention to his posts, even though I consider myself quite knowledgeable about web content production and accessibility. Somehow, Stas consistently manages to dig out the tricky, under-documented cases and present robust solutions for them. He is a master of concision, communicating the key points in brief, simple language. 

From my own teaching experiences, I am painfully aware how difficult this is, especially in a second language. If you have hours to spare, you can gorge yourself on the many other fully-stuffed websites, but if you need leaner insights and rapid enlightenment, turn to Stas.”
